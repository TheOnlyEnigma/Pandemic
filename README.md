# Netlogo Project 
## Pandemic

A model created using the GIS extension in Netlogo to show the spread of a disease through the world's population

## Getting Started

The only file that is needed to work the model is...


## Prerequisities and Installing

Before running this program Netlogo will need to be downloaded from: 
_https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml_  
Any version should work and allow for the model to run, however Netlogo 5.3.1 was utilised
during this project, so it may be recommended to download this version, instead of the 6.0
beta version as this may prove to have some of unknown issues

With the version that is downloaded it is also important to make sure that some of the free
example codes are also downloaded in, and these can be found typically in a file like this:
_/Program Files/NetLogo 5.3.1/app/models/Code Examples/GIS/data/_
This file should contain a number of files including shape files, however the ones of 
importance for this project is the *WGS_84_Geographic*, *cities.shp* and *countries.shp*
